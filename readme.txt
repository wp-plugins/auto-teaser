Automatically generates a teaser for posts, pages and custom post types.

== Description ==

**Auto Teaser** is a useful plugin that automatically generates a teaser of a post. page or [custom post types](http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Types).

Auto Teaser allows you to customize how the teasers are generated by the following settings:

* The teaser format Auto Teaser will use when generating the teaser,
* the teaser split style which tells Auto Teaser how long a teaser has to be and where it breaks the content,
* whether you'd like WordPress' native `the_excerpt()` and `get_the_excerpt()` to be automatically replaced with the generated teaser,
* if Auto Teaser is allowed to use HTML inside teaser or not,
* and a list of post IDs Auto Teaser will ignore.

Furthermore, the plugin will provide several PHP functions that offer additional options and let developers generate teasers manually.

**As always, Auto Teaser comes with a [detailed documentation](http://www.koljanolte.com/wordpress/plugins/auto-teaser/) that gives information on every aspect of the plugin.**
